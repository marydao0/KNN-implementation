# KNN-implementation

Implementation of K nearest neighbors algorithm in Python using NumPy and SciPy. Distance measures include cosine, Euclidean, and city block/Manhattan distances.

Main function returns accuracy of KNN predictions. Testing of the function performed on the MNIST dataset and accuracies are reported for both training and testing datasets.
